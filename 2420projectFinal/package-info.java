/*
My final project is going to be a type of transaction builder. Basically the "merchant" will be able to add "date" "first name" "last name" "item purchased" and "amount" 
using a scanner that will put it into a linkedlist and then they can press a key (maybe 1 or something) that will open a terminal with multiple
people in it, but that new person will be added to the history of transactions with all of the data that I've already hard-coded in into the console.

We could also create some type of change counter if we wanted to, but first lets get this program running
