Tyler's JAVA Projects

Hello!

This is my JAVA repository. In here you will find all of my main projects that I do for class or just on the side for fun
and learning opportunities. The goal of this is to show anyone who looks at my Github to see my code become better and more
efficient with each upload/program written. It's to also show how fast my learning curve is and that I'm more than willing
to put an exponential amount of time and effort into anything that needs to be done or if I just want to learn something on my
own, I'll take the time and do it.
